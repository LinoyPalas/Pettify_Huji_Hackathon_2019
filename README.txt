Our Android app for the Huji Hackathon 2019 Competition.
We created an application which turnes pets adoption to interactive and fun experience.
In the backend we created a database which is based on data given by non-profit organizations in Israe.

Our goal is to make pets adoption more afordable and easy to people ,
and to give people few options for pets which is "good" or "fit" their needs and abilities.
